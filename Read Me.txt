So this is a Python program that will eventually work as a calculator. What sets it apart is its ability to round, not only to significant digits, yet also 
to scientific notation! About those significant digits, the program will find those itself, so removing the need for tedious counting

The current program is more of a pile of useful functions, than a functioning program, so some tinkering will be needed to use this early release

WARNING: Only use program with periods and numbers. Do not attempt to input any other character, as it will lead to unexpected results

Feel free to contact voovs.13@gmail.com and supervipjim@icloud.com if you have any questions, comments, or concerns

Sincerely, 

Voovs and Ching
