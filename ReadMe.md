Vova's Calculator:
So this is a Python program that will eventually work as a calculator. What sets
it apart is its ability to round, not only to significant digits, yet also to
scientific notation! About those significant digits, the program will find those
itself, so removing the need for tedious counting.

The current program is more of a pile of useful functions, than a functioning
program, so some tinkering will be needed to use this early release

WARNING: Only use program with periods and numbers. Do not attempt to input any
other character, as it will lead to unexpected results

Ching's Calculator:
This calculator is smart enough to round to the significant digits when
multiplying or dividing, and to round to the correct decimal when adding or
subtracting. It puts the answer in scientific notation if necessary, and it is
capable of doing calculations with units and unit conversions.

This program is made with many exceptions, meaning that it should not return any
errors, so if you run into any errors (red text printed by Python that stops the
program), please report back.

Feel free to contact voovs.13@gmail.com or chingtheprogrammer@icloud.com if you
have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Sincerely,

Voovs and Ching
